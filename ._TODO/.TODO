== SOON ==
* Add reordering items back in again (currently commented out in edit/list-items.tpl.html due to editing styling I believe) SEE: to-dos in the list-item.directive
* Add delete item (if doesn't already exist and is commented out like above)
* ADD TESTS (JS i.e., Karma, Jasmine) if logic exists yet
* Maybe move second part of request chain on controllers active()->{{{getList()}}}, that interacts with http service to commands to avoid duplication/unnecessary code
* Standardise response from PHP backend in the form of a shared response object (eg ListsResponse, ErrorResponse)
* Notifications for frontend

== AT SOME POINT ==
* Rewrite creation/updating in PHP backend - currently messy and probably doesn't use Laravel/Eloquent well. Look into mapper objects or Fractal
