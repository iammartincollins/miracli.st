== SOON ==
* Add more tests
* Maybe move second part of request chain on controllers active()->{{{getList()}}}, that interacts with http service to commands to avoid duplication/unnecessary code
* Standardise response from PHP backend in the form of a shared response object (eg ListsResponse, ErrorResponse)
* Notifications for frontend

== AT SOME POINT ==
* Rewrite creation/updating in PHP backend - currently messy and probably doesn't use Laravel/Eloquent well. Look into mapper objects or Fractal
* Deployment


== VISUAL ==
* Switch from FontAwesome to better font library for interfaces (FA is overused) such as Themify icons
