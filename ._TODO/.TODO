== SOON ==
* Abandon Elixir, try standard gulp or grunt
* Move tests back into their modules, not separate folder (can't seem to exclude with Elixir)
* Add more tests
* Maybe move second part of request chain on controllers active()->{{{getList()}}}, that interacts with http service to commands to avoid duplication/unnecessary code
* Standardise response from PHP backend in the form of a shared response object (eg ListsResponse, ErrorResponse)
* Notifications for frontend

== AT SOME POINT ==
* Rewrite creation/updating in PHP backend - currently messy and probably doesn't use Laravel/Eloquent well. Look into mapper objects or Fractal
